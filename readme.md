This is a very trivial example of how to use `d3`. I am also using `gulp` to build and `typescript` for typing support.

### Build

If you are using visual studio code, you should be able to just run hit `cmd+shift+b` on OSX or `ctrl+shift+b` on windows. (only tried this on OSX).
Alternatively, you can run `gulp` from the command line in the root directory as long as you have gulp installed. `npm install gulp -g`.
